## Backend Implementation Notes:
For the two-step process, your backend needs:

1. **Step 1 API Call**: `POST /strategy` with `{craft, location}` → Returns budget options
2. **Step 2 API Call**: `POST /strategy` with `{craft, location, selected_tier: "mid"}` → Returns 3 detailed strategies

The AI will recognize `selected_tier` parameter and return detailed strategies for that budget range.

## Validation Rules:
- Budget breakdowns must always total the stated budget exactly
- Each allocation should have clear implementation purpose
- Strategy working steps should reference specific spending amounts
- Focus on practical, actionable budget utilization
