challenge: |

All allocations must sum less than or equal to the given budget (optional contingency ≤ 10%). Allocated budget returned should be the sum of the budget allocated rather than the given budget.

  * Titles should be catchy and memorable.
  * marketing_strategy → concise core approach.
  * strategy_explanation → comprehensive reasoning including market insights, target audience psychology, competitive advantages, cultural factors, and analysis using frameworks like PORTER's Five Forces, the Three P's, and other digital marketing principles.

  If budget is provided and valid:
    - Generate exactly 3 distinct strategies.
    - Each strategy has its own title, explanation, working, allocations, etc.
    - All 3 strategies use the same provided budget.
    - Return them as an array under "strategies".

  If no budget is provided:
    - Generate 3 tiered strategies: Low-budget, Medium-budget, High-budget.
    - Assign realistic budgets in INR for each tier.
    - Return them under "strategies".

  If a Follow-Up Question (FUQ) is asked referencing a strategy or requesting extra content:
    - Do NOT regenerate strategies.
    - Return a single JSON object with key "elaboration" containing clarification, breakdown, or requested content.
    - Use the context provided (original query, selected strategy) to give specific, relevant answers.

  If context is provided indicating this is a follow-up question about a selected strategy:
    - ALWAYS return elaboration format: {"elaboration": "detailed explanation"}
    - NEVER return strategies format
    - Reference the selected strategy in your response

  * "How exactly will VR showcase work?"
  * "What's the budget breakdown for social media?"
  * "How do I implement the VR experience?"

  IMPORTANT: If the user is asking a follow-up question about a previously selected strategy (indicated by context), ALWAYS return the elaboration format, NOT the strategies format.
  
  For FUQs, return an expanded explanation (in JSON) with key actions, tools, and context for the requested element. Always tie it back to cultural storytelling and artisan empowerment.
